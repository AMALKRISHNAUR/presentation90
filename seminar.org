* Why we need Transform
 - Mathematical transformations are applied to signals to obtain further information
   from that signal that is not readily available in the raw signal. There are number of
   transformations that can be applied to signals. 
* Fourier Transform
 - Fourier transform is defined as the sum of over all time of the signal f(t) multiplied
   by a complex exponential [ a complex exponential can be broken down into real
   and imaginary sinusoidal components]. The result of the transform are the Fourier
   Coefficients F(ω), which when multiplied by a sinusoid of appropriate frequency
   ω yield the constituent sinusoidal component of the original signal. 
** FT
 - \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega)e^{j\omega x} dx \]
 - \[ F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)e^{-j\omega x} d\omega \]

* What are stationary and non stationary signals? 
 - Signals whose frequency content that do not change with time are called as stationary
   signals . In other words, the frequency content of stationary signals do not change
   with time. In this case, one does not need to know at what times frequency
   components exist , since all frequency components exist at all times !!! .
** Example
   - For example the following signal is a stationary signal, because it has frequencies
     of 10, 25 and 50 Hz at any given time instant. This signal is plotted below:
     x(t)=cos(2*pi*5*t)+cos(2*pi*25*t)+cos(2*pi*50*t )
** Spectrum of that signal

** Non stationary signal
 - x_{5}(t) = [x_{1} $\bigoplus$ x_{2} $\bigoplus$ x_{3} ]
** Spectrum ofthat signals

* STFT Transform
** STFT
 - it solve the problem of FT 
 - Gabor Transfom allow us to compute spectrogram a time frequency plot
** STFT
 - A non stationary signal appears to be stationary for small durations. In STFT, the
   signal is divided into small enough segments, where these segments (portions) of
   the signal can be assumed to be stationary. For this purpose, a window function
   "w" is chosen. The width of this window must be equal to the segment of the
   signal where its stationarity is valid. Then we take the FT of segmented
   consecutive pieces of a signal. Each FT then provides the spectral content of that
   time segment only.
   Hence STFT gives
       a. Spectral content for different time intervals.
       b. Time-frequency representation.
  Mathematically STFT can be represented by, 
 
** STFT
 - \[ STFT(f(t)) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)e^{-i \omega \tau} W(\tau - t) d \tau \]
 - W is the window function it can be gaussian or rectangular
 - We can't know what frequency exist at what time instead but we can know what frequency band exist at what time

** Uncertainty Principe
 - Uncertainity principle
 - It statesthat when you narrow the window you get better time resolution but you get poor frequency resolution
 - when you stretch the window you get better frquency information but poor time information that is what
 - uncertainity principle tell us
 - \Delta t \Delta f \geq $\frac{1}{4 \pi}

* Wavelet Transform
 - Wavelet Transform overcomes the preset resolution problem of the STFT by using
   a variable length window.
 - The function used to window the signal is called the wavelet
 - Analysis windows of different lengths are used for different frequencies
    - Analysis of high frequencies- Use narrower windows for better time
      resolution
    - Analysis of low frequencies - Use wider windows for better frequency
      resolution
** Mother Wavelet
 - The term wavelet means a small wave. The smallness refers to the condition that
   this (window) function is of finite length (compactly supported)
 - The wave refers to the condition that this function is oscillatory.
 - The term mother implies that the
   functions with different region of support that are used in the transformation
   process are derived from one main function, or the mother wavelet. In other
   words, the mother wavelet is a prototype for generating the other window
   functions. 
** Properties of wavelets
*** Scaling 
   - Scale is a frequency parameter which is defined as 1/frequency. 
   - low frequencies (high scales) correspond to a global information of a
     signal (that usually spans the entire signal), whereas high frequencies (low scales)
     correspond to a detailed information of a hidden pattern in the signal (that
     usually lasts a relatively short time).
   - High frequency content in a signal means sharply varying part of the signal and
     low frequency content in a signal means smoothly varying part of the signal. 
*** Translation
    - The term translation is related to the location of the window, as the window is
     shifted through the signal. This term, obviously, corresponds to time information
     in the transform domain.
** CWT
    - Now we have basis function to calculate coefficient only we need to project the function into basis.
    - The  wavelet transform coefficients are calculated by
      an inner-product of the input signal with a set of orthonormal basis functions
    - So mathamatically continues wavelet transform become
    - \[ W(a,b) = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt[2] a} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)  \psi^* (\frac{t-b}{a}) \]
    - Use wavemenu in matlab

* Uses of wavelet transform
 - Used in image compression (jpeg 2000)
 - image denoising
 - image fusion
* Conclusion
 - The wavelet transform are very useful and powerful to analyse the signals
 - it can detect discontinuity and it is best choise for function which has jumps
 - It tells both frequency and time so it is ideal choice for audio processing
 - Wavelets are used in compression and Denoising images as well as audio
